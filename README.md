# CryptoClustering
Here’s a brief summary of what I’ve learned:

DData Normalization:

I used StandardScaler from scikit-learn to normalize my data, which involved scaling features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helped me standardize the range of the features in my dataset.
Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:

I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of dimensions in my dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. PCA transformed my data into a new coordinate system, capturing the most significant variance along the principal components.
Clustering with K-Means:

I performed K-Means clustering to group the data into clusters based on similarity. I used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualized the clustering results to understand the grouping.
Visualization:

I created various plots to visualize the clustering results and the impact of PCA. This included scatter plots and line charts, which helped me identify patterns and relationships in the data.
DataFrame Manipulation:

I learned how to manipulate DataFrames by copying data, setting indexes, and adding new columns based on clustering results.
Overall, these steps allowed me to preprocess, analyze, and visualize complex datasets effectively.
